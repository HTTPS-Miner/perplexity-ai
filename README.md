# Selenium Browser Automation for perplexity.ai

## Overview

This project automates interactions with perplexity-ai on the [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai/) website using **selenium** and **Firefox**. The script allows you to send text input from a file, receive the response from ChatGPT, and save it to an output file â€” all without manually opening a browser.
